 * Testcase Example:  '[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly
 * increasing subsequence.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore
 * the length is 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
 * -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time
 * complexity?
