 * Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps
 * required to make word1 and word2 the same.
 * 
 * In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to
 * make "eat" to "ea".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 *
