 *
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n
 * chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens'
 * placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space,
 * respectively.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
 * Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as
 * shown above
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: [["Q"]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 9
