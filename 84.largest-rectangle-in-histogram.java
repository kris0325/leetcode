 *
 * Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height
 * where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle
 * in the histogram.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
 * The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10
 * units.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: heights = [2,4]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
 * 0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4
 *
